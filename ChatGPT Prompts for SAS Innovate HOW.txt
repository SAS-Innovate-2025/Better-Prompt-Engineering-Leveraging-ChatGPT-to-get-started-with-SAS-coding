I have a question about assigning SAS libraries. Instead of writing out the full path to a library, such as libname HHS "/home/student/HHS_OTJ", how can I use a ~ to shorten the path?  And what exactly does the ~ do?

Thanks! I’d now like to write some SAS code that will help me download a .CSV file from a GitHub page. The data file is found here: https://github.com/lincolngroves/SAS-OTJ-HHS/blob/main/ACS_2015_2022_ltd.csv. Can you please help me write this code?

That code looks like it worked – but the proc http step has an error.  Can you write me some new code that doesn’t use proc http? Additionally, can you just print the first 100 observations? Thanks!

I'd like to better understand my new SAS data set HHS.HHS_OTJ_Raw. Can you help me write some SAS code which summarizes all the numeric and non-numeric variables in the dataset? Bonus points for graphs - and thanks!

For step 3 and step 4, I'm getting the error message that _numeric_ and _character_ are not found.  Can you write that code another way?

Hmmm.  That code is very complex.  Let's try again.  Can you add plots to the proc univariate and proc freq statements to produce graphs for the numeric and non-numeric variables, respectively?

I’m struggling to understand some complex proc SQL code in SAS. Allegedly, this code takes a very long data set and collapses the data to a much small number of observations, while creating a bunch of new variables. Can you help explain it to me like I’m a 10 year old? Here is the code:

Can you please create a SAS program that creates a nice summary table of the new variables in the hhs.covid_labor_supply data set?

Alright, one more trick. Can you please help me write some SAS code that will use the hhs.covid_labor_supply data set and examine UE_Women, UE_Women_NoKids, UE_Women_OlderKids, and UE_Women_YoungKids by state over time? The time variable is year and the state variable is named state_name. Thank you!

I don't actually see that the code you provided grouped the data by state_name. Can you please try again and create new code which produces separate graphs for each state? Thank you!
